Dice Game
This project is a simple web-based Dice Game that simulates a dice roll competition between two players. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the game provides an engaging way to determine a winner based on random dice rolls. Upon loading the page, two dice are displayed on the screen, each representing a player. The JavaScript logic generates a random number between 1 and 6 for each player, updates the dice images accordingly, and determines the winner based on the highest roll. If both players roll the same number, the game results in a draw.

The user interface is styled with CSS to create an attractive and cohesive design, utilizing the 'Lobster' and 'Indie Flower' fonts for a playful look. The title "Refresh Me" encourages users to reload the page, triggering a new roll of the dice each time. The layout centers the content on the page and uses vibrant colors for text and background to enhance visual appeal. The dice images are dynamically updated using JavaScript to reflect the outcome of each roll.

To play the game, simply open the index.html file in a web browser and refresh the page to roll the dice. The game scripts are included in index.js, while the styles are defined in styles.css. The images of the dice are located in the images directory, with filenames corresponding to each dice face (e.g., dice1.png, dice2.png). This project serves as a fun and interactive way to practice web development skills, offering a straightforward example of using JavaScript for DOM manipulation and randomization in a browser-based game.
